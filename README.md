The JavaScript Calculator is a web-based application that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The application consists of three main components:

1. **HTML**: Defines the structure of the calculator, including input fields for operands and operators, and buttons for numbers and arithmetic operations.
2. **CSS**: Styles the calculator, providing a clean and simple layout.
3. **JavaScript**: Manages the functionality of the calculator, handling button clicks, performing calculations, and updating the display.

## Features

1. **Inserting Numbers**: Click the number buttons to insert digits into the operands.
2. **Selecting an Operator**: Click an operator button to choose the arithmetic operation.
3. **Calculating**: Click the '=' button to calculate the result.
4. **Clearing Input**: Click the 'C' button to clear the input fields and start a new calculation.

## Files
